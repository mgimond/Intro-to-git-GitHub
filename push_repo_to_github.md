Proceed with the following steps when you are ready to push (upload) your local project folder back to your github account. Note that you do not need to wait until you feel as though you have a final version of your assignment or project before pushing it to your github account. You can push many different versions of you project folder as needed.

1. Make sure that you've saved any project R/Rmd script before pushing your project folder.  

2. The final step is to **push** your local commited files/folders to your Github repo as follows:  

  `git push -u origin master`

   If you are prompted for a username/password, recall that the password is the [Personal Access Token you created up on GitHub](authenticating_with_github.md). But note that if the token is saved in your local user profile, you will not be prompted for a password.
